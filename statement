David is passionate about software, software engineering, and
addressing the problem of how the software sector can improve
the quality of science research.

Since gaining an undergraduate degree in maths and a
postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science from University of Cambridge,
David has worked in a variety of commercial software companies.
The work has been varied, ranging from writing real-time garbage
collectors, through to 3D video games, robots, programming language
implementation, information retrieval, and most recently
collaborative web-based programming tools.

David was fortunate that his first job, writing garbage
collectors for a dynamic object oriented programming language,
made it crystal clear that commitment to software engineering
would pay off.  In debugging problems with a garbage collector,
one is often debugging the problem well after the ultimate
cause, and with little evidence.  Up front effort in design,
documentation, and ultimately capturing user requirements, was
always saved by avoiding those long nights poring over
hex-dumps.
