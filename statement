## SUPPORTING STATEMENT ##

Science researchers have not been trained in the
computing skills that will help them make the greatest advances
in science.  Science is suffering as a result, and we should do
something about it.

David is passionate about software, software engineering, and
addressing the problem of how the software sector can improve
the quality of science research.  David feels that his goals are
well aligned with those of myGrid, The Software Sustainability
Institute (SSI), and a growing community of researchers who are
becoming aware of the "software gap".

David's nearly 20 years of software development in a diverse
range of commercial companies have given him a rock solid basis in
software and software engineering.  He relishes the prospect of using
his knowledge of these skills to energise and strengthen the research
software community.  In reading this document, it will be useful
to know that the Climate Code Foundation is a non-profit that
David founded, and that ScraperWiki Limited is his current
employer.

Communicating software results has often been a part of David's
activities: he has written case studies, website content, and
promoted best practice, in both a professional context and a
personal one.  David has presented work to clients, internally
within a company, and externally at conferences (a typical
example would be "Embedded Programming with Python", PyCon UK 2008).

David's writings are sometimes entirely solo efforts, but mostly involve
at least some collaboration at the concept, content, or editorial level.
David is confident in communicating a variety of messages in a variety
of media.  David tweets (@drjtwit), and has experimented with automated
science communication using Twitter (@isithotornot, currently dormant).

David can present proposals, lead discussions, summarise, pitch,
demonstrate, inform, and cajole, using a variety of media from
business cards and napkins, to telephone calls, flipcharts, and
slides made with OmniGraffle and InkScape.  In a business context
David has presented to colleagues, clients and potential clients,
partners; he also enjoys presenting at conferences such as EuroPython
and UKUUG, and community groups such as PySheff, PyNorthwest,
and CamPUG (Sheffield, Manchester, and Cambridge respectively).

So far for 2013 David is expecting to teach CoffeeScript and POSIX
shell at the FLOSS UK conference in March, and present a case-study
from his work at ScraperWiki at the same conference.  David has a
provisional engagement volunteering to teach shell at the Software
Carpentry Bootcamp at the University of Manchester in April.

David maintains a personal blog (http://drj11.wordpress.com/),
co-writes The Climate Code Foundation blog (http://climatecode.org/),
helps maintain ScraperWiki's blog (current employer,
http://blog.scraperwiki.com), and occasionally guest writes for other
blogs such as Open Knowledge Foundation.  Some of this writing is quite
technical, some whimsical, and some scientific.  Most is self-proofed
and edited, but David prefers to work in collaboration with others and
arranges that where possible.

David has administered a student intern programme at the
non-profit Climate Code Foundation, and mentored students in
that programme and in ad-hoc internship at ScraperWiki Limited.
He expects that this will help him in working with the SSI
Fellows and the Fellows Alumni.

David has built, and continues to build, contacts in the academic
community as part of his work at Climate Code Foundation, meeting and
collaborating with scientists and academic support staff in Canada,
NCDC and NASA in the USA, Edinburgh (specifically, Neil Chue Hong
(Director of SSI), and Mike Jackson), the UK Met Office, the National
Oceanographic Centre.  He will enjoy reaching out to more of the UK HE
community and representing the Software Sustainability Institute.

David has enjoyed attending events similar to ones he would be
helping to organise as a Community Specialist (he met Neil at
one) and looks forward to learning how to organise them.
Recently David has volunteered as a helper at the Software
Carpentry Bootcamp at The University of Edinburgh.

The topic of how software is used in science has been one of the
activities of the Climate Code Foundation; David looks forward
to building upon this work and developing it further,
particularly in a more formal context (such as conferences and
papers).


## FRAMED BIOGRAPHY ##

Since gaining an undergraduate degree in maths and a postgraduate
Diploma in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge,
David has worked in a variety of commercial software companies.
The work has been varied, ranging from writing real-time garbage
collectors, through to 3D video games, robots, programming
language implementation, information retrieval, and most recently
collaborative web-based programming tools.

David was fortunate that his first job, writing garbage collectors for
a dynamic object oriented programming language, made it crystal clear
that commitment to software engineering would pay off.  In debugging
problems with a garbage collector, one is often debugging the problem
well after the ultimate cause, and with little evidence.  In making
truly reliable software he found the weapons of design, documentation,
and user requirements management to be invaluable.  It certainly beats
long nights poring over hex-dumps.

Making software has always been a collaborative effort,
involving liaison with various groups, sometimes within a
company (internal customers), often with a second party
(contracting, clients), and sometimes with third parties
(sub-contracting, partners, and so on).  In these collaborations
David has held various r√¥les from support to architect.

In 2008 David joined the Climate Change blog wars.  NASA had
recently published the source code to their GISTEMP dataset,
which is a reconstruction of Earth's historical global temperature
record from surface temperature observations (weather stations).
Certain aspects of the public debate began to cast doubt on
the clarity, and therefore the correctness, of NASA's source code.
Seizing this opportunity to use many accumulated years' worth of
skills in software to bring benefit to climate science and to
clarify the public debate, David joined forces with colleague
Nick Barnes to create ccc-gistemp.  This collaboration is a fully
open source project to reimplement NASA's GISTEMP algorithm with
identical results.  Since it began, the project has attracted
some contributions from other people.  ccc-gistemp reimplements
in Python NASA's program of a few thousand lines of Fortran, C,
shell, and Python.  Python was chosen for its clarity and ability to
communicate to non-programmers.  The result is smaller and clearer,
and has helped to eliminate some confusion in the public debate.

ccc-gistemp has been presented at conferences, and has resulted so far
in one peer-reviewed publication [BARNESJONES2011], and a number of
collaborations with scientists (including [HAUSFATHERETAL2012]).  All
of the work on ccc-gistemp has been pro bono.  The project can be viewed
at https://code.google.com/p/ccc-gistemp/; it is often the subject of
blog posts at http://climatecode.org/.

The success of ccc-gistemp encouraged David and Nick to found the
non-profit Climate Code Foundation, along with Philippa Davey.
The Foundation's activities have been limited by lack of funding,
but one of the activities of The Foundation has been participating in
Google's Summer of Code program.  David has written the pitches (The
Foundation has to apply each year), administered this participation,
and has mentored one of the students (and co-mentored others).
In total The Foundation has mentored 5 students (a mixture
of graduates and undergraduates) over two years, all of whom
successfully completed the programme.  The Foundation has given
David a credible platform from which to reach out to the (mostly
climate) science community in the UK and internationally.

David's current job is First Engineer for the Silicon Valley-style
startup ScraperWiki based in the Northwest of England.  He is
responsible for all engineering requirements, implementation,
and performance.  There are about 7 people in the entire company
and about 3 of those comprise the engineering team, which is
largely self-managing.  In such a small company everyone does
a bit of everything, and has to learn how to do new things.
David has built websites, programmed servers in Python, node.js,
CoffeeScript, done customer discovery, experimented with UX design
(under the careful oversight of ScraperWiki's actual UX designer),
and of course been instrumental in implementing the industry's
latest software engineering fad, Agile.  Most of the engineering
activities are planned in two-week iterations and are pair programmed
(or pair-estimated, pair-written, and so on, according to the task).
